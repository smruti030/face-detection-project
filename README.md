# Face Detection Using OpenCV

This project demonstrates a face detection application using Python and OpenCV. The program detects faces in images and video streams by utilizing Haar cascades and highlights each detected face with a bounding box.

## Project Overview

Face detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and locates human faces in digital images. It is widely used in applications such as security, photography, social media, and more. This project uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time from a webcam feed or static images.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Uses Haar cascades to detect faces within images or video frames.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Supports real-time face detection via a webcam.
- **Simple and Fast**: Implements efficient algorithms for quick processing and detection.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or above is recommended).

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smruti030/face-detection-project.git
   cd face-detection-project
